											<p>Exploring the intersections between language, culture, and identity is a huge passion of mine. I was initially able to delve into this by completing my Masters in Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University. Currently, I work as a Speech Language Pathologist with preschool and school-aged children. I provide consultation, assessments and treatment in the areas of early communication, language development, social language, and articulation. My experience in research, leadership, and clinical positions has allowed me to foster close bonds with multidisciplinary team members and families. Since COVID-19 hit, I have been exploring the barriers our clients face when navigating remote service delivery and online therapy.</p>

											<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary, researching risk and protective factors for brain development in preschool kids such as breastfeeding and prenatal alcohol exposure. I also work as a behavior interventionist with children/adolescents with developmental disabilities, implementing language, motor, cognitive, and behavior therapies. This interdisciplinary foundation in neurodevelopment allows me to leverage neuroimaging as a tool to understand the brain while also appreciating the experiences of youth and families. I strongly value knowledge translation and mobilization between disciplines, and I continuously strive for each of my roles as a graduate student and an interventionist to inform each other. This motivated my interest in Neuro Nexus, which capitalizes on integrative thinking between siloed groups to create truly sustainable solutions. In my role as co-director, I am excited to work alongside a talented executive team to recruit intriguing challenges about brain and mental health in Alberta. </p>

																	<p>My name is Kush Padalia, and I'm currently a student at the University of Alberta. I'm in my first year of Bachelor of Science, General program but, I am planning on transferring into Computer Science Specialization next year. My current major is in biological sciences, and my minor is in computer science. I am capable of working with Python and have an admiration for technology. I live in Fort McMurray with my younger sister and parents. My hobbies include playing basketball and piano. I am excited to work and learn from various people who each have their unique skills and look forward to helping build an experience that will last a lifetime.</p>

																	<p>I am so excited to be working on this project! In the past I have worked with BrainSTEM Alliance to develop an application, to introduce to the Girls Inc. Program. The mission was to involve young girls in Chemical Engineering concepts (Process Flow Diagrams), through a drag and drop type game that digitalized one of their workshops. This project was meaningful to me as I participated in the same workshop through the Girls Inc program, years ago. However, back then the workshop was simply drawing the Process Flow Diagrams onto a poster board. Hope to bring a positive energy to the NeuroNexus program as well!I am currently the Operations Manager for RoboGals at the University of Alberta, and hope to grow my skillset, by being exposed to unique minds through this program. I aspire to bring my learnings back to the RoboGals program and inspire young girls to continue their involvement in STEM fields in the near future. </p>

																	<p>Greetings! My name is Jingyi and I am a Second Year Nursing Student at the University of Alberta. I have won the Monsanto Commercialization Award at the 2016 Sanofi Biogenius Canada Competition with my research project that discovered a novel genetic marker to detect fusarium head blight in wheat using ddPCR. In 2018, I was a finalist in the Sanofi Biogenius Alberta Regional Competition with my project on tissue engineering and identifying osteoarthritic changes of the meniscus in a zero-gravity environment. Currently, I am a research volunteer at Dr. Cao's Lab at the University of Alberta, learning about Machine Learning and its applications in Psychology and Clinical Diagnosis. Outside of research and academia, I am the founder of the COVID19 Chinese Conversation Program. This is a Non-profit Organization that provides free virtual Mandarin Tutoring for K - 12 Students in the Chinese Bilingual Program in Edmonton. Our aim is to help students who do not reside in a Mandarin speaking household to retain their Mandarin skills during the lockdown caused by the pandemic. As of today, we have had over 300 conversations, helped over 40 families across Edmonton, and received encouragement and appreciation from the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. I am more than excited to embark once again on a new journey with other brilliant minds! I look forward to working with all of you, solve real world problems with real world solutions, and combine our passions and expertise into an impactful project.</p>
